ISPP School Summary Data Analysis

Goal: Using Python, an exploratory data analysis was completed using the Iowa School Performance Profile (ISPP) data collected from the 2022-2023 Academic Year. The insights gathered can be used to determine efficacy of current support and policy for the Iowa Department of Education as well as to guide future policy and advocacy for specific vulnerable populations. 


Data Questions:

  1) How do schools with a greater percentage of low-socioeconomic status students perform compared to those with a smaller percentage (using FRL as a measure)?
  2) How do schools with a greater percentage of students having an IEP Plan perform compared to those with a smaller percentage?
  3) What is the distribution of school performance ratings in the state (i.e. “Exceptional”, “Needs Improvement”, etc.)?
  4) Is there variation across school levels (elementary, middle, high school) in how they perform on the school index when in the same school district?
